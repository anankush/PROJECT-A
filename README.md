													PROJECT-A: Admission Portal System


PROJECT-A is a complete web-based Admission Portal System developed to modernize and automate the student admission process for schools, colleges, and educational institutions. Instead of relying on traditional offline methods like physical form submissions, long queues, manual verification, and paper-based documentation, this system provides a fully digital workflow where students and institutions can manage the entire admission cycle online.

This project aims to remove the inefficiencies of manual admission handling by offering a centralized web platform where students can register, fill out application forms, upload documents, and submit admission requests from anywhere. On the administrative side, institutions can easily review applicants, manage their data, check required documents, and process admissions in a structured format with significantly reduced paperwork and human errors.

The system is built using PHP and a relational database, making it easy to deploy on standard hosting environments such as XAMPP, WAMP, or any LAMP server. The database structure included in the DB folder provides the complete schema for storing student information, admission requests, credentials, and supporting metadata. The project follows a simple and easy-to-understand file structure, enabling beginners and advanced developers alike to extend or customize the system according to their needs.
